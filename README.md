# Purpose 

I created this particular repository to get in touch with
graphical programming and understanding how GPUs work. 
Alongwith understanding the capabilities of the Vulkan
API, it would help reignite my dormant passion for 
computer graphics and possibly computer vision. 

Beginning now and will refine this readme as well as 
the content in this repository to fulfill the following:
1. Build my own graphics library.
2. Understand Vulkan based GPU programming.
3. Develop this library to be utilised with software:
   1. For visualising data.
   2. Graphs and 3D generated objects.


Will further add more stuff here as I get a feel for the
API. :)
